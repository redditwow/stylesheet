# /r/wow subreddit theme

## Building

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `example_config.json` to `config.json` and optionally enable automatic deployments to staging
3. `gulp styles` to compile for the first time. Use `gulp` to compile and watch for changes or `gulp watch` to just watch.
4. `gulp webp` to convert spritesheets to webp format.
5. `gulp` to watch for changes

## Installation

1. Upload all the images in the `images` directory
2. Upload all the spritesheet images
    * These files require manually adding a version number on the end to bust reddit's cache. The version number is manually set in the gulp file for each individual file.
3. Copy and paste all of `css/prod.css` into your subreddit's CSS setting
4. In your subreddit settings: upload `spritesheet_images/snoo/x-snoo.png` as the header image
5. In the flair settings, set user and link flair to display on the left

## Automatic Deployments to Staging

When the stylesheet is compiled, gulp can optionally upload the CSS to a staging subreddit. Note this does not (yet) handle image uploads, nor does it handle errors (e.g. missing images or CSS rules that reddit doesn't accept). To enable this:
 
1. Create a [script app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) on the reddit account you want to use to deploy code with. The name, description and URLs don't matter. Set them to anything you want.
2. Set `automaticStagingDeployment` to `true` in `config.json` and fill out the other config options with the client ID and secret, and your account and password.
3. Enjoy automatic deployments.

# Notes

## Images and Sprites

Most individual sprite images are Fireworks PNGs. This includes: 
   * The Snoo and logo, where the glow effect is a filter; 
   * The sidebar images with a hover effect, where the inner glow is also a filter;
   * The RES markdown editor toolbar buttons, where the glyphs are fonts and can be rescaled easy to support multiple DPIs;
